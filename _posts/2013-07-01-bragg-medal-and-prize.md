The 2013 recipient has been announced and is Bob Kibble. From <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/education/bragg/medallists/page_60408.html">the citation</a>, Bob receives this award for "...his life-long contributions to the teaching of physics in all phases of education, from primary school to further and higher education.

resource development and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) have inspired many and enhanced their interest in physics. He has given his time and expertise selflessly to the Association for Science Education, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Rank Prize funded Optoelectronics College.

Many of his former students attribute their success to the firm foundation they received through his teaching. He not only covered the required physics but ensured that they had firm understanding of the concepts involved. In 1997, Bob Kibble transferred his talents to teacher training and has influenced, in similar manner, approximately 300 new physics teachers since then".

We all wish Bob hearty congratulations for this thoroughly well deserved recognition.
