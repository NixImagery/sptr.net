SPTR.net was for several years, a resource sharing site for physics teachers in Scotland. That role was taken up by Sally over at [Guzled](https://www.guzledscotland.com/) in 2016.

I have this week relocated the sptr.net[^domain] website to a new home, and removed a lot of the old, dead posts, keeping just a few of particular interest or significance.

[^domain]: The sptr.net domain is either not for sale, or you canâ€™t afford it.
