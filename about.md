Who am I? My name is Nick Hood, I am a physicist, educator and technologist working in Edinburgh. I have sustained an interest in internet and other technologies for many years and hold professional qualifications in software development. Some of this interest is revenue-generating, some just for the challenge. Get in touch if you have a question.
