SPTR.net was for several years, a resource sharing site for physics teachers in Scotland. That role was taken up by Sally over at <a href="https://scotland.guzled.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guzled</a> in 2016.

Who am I? My name is Nick Hood, I am a physicist, educator and technologist working in initial teacher education in Edinburgh. I have sustained an interest in internet and other technologies for many years and hold professional qualifications in software development. Some of this interest is revenue-generating, some just for the challenge. Get in touch if you have a question.
